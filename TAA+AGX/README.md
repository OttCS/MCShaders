# TAA
Low-impact, fairly okay anti-aliasing method

# AGX
Inspired by Blender 4.0 AGX View Transform: More realistic renders by letting colors naturally become over-exposed. I let the light values stay super varied, nighttime being around 10% and daylight being at 120%. By having the camera adjust the exposure (while keeping most skylit scenes the same), I'm able to show off much more detail and naturally let things end up in deep shadows or bright light.

# Other
I kept this as vanilla-looking as possible, outside of the warmer lights.
