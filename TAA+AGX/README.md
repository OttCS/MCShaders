# TAA
Temporal Anti-Aliasing is fairly cheap for decent results, even if it's a little blury in motion

# AGX
Upcoming Blender 4.0 View Transform for much more realistic lights.

# and...
- A mostly vanilla feel
- More "expressive" lighting: Blocklights have an "overexposure" to blow out a small radius, skylighting is tuned to be slightly more realistic
- Auto-exposure to help keep scene lighting in better balance, and really emphasize shadows in sunlight or lights in dark areas
